# Five Step Approach to Saving America

This document aims to provide a simple, provable, low-risk endeavor to directly address a majority of the United States of America's biggest issues. Specifically:

- Poverty
- Homelessness
- Debt
- Mental Illness (directly linked to poverty)
- Lack of democractic representation

These steps are designed to be completable by a federal government agency within the span of a few weeks, and do not add or remove wealth from any individual or business other than The Federal Reserve banking group. The Federal Reserve is not a government entity, and yet controls all of the money in the country. This makes no sense, and is the root of many of the issues in the country.

## Step 1 - United States Alternative Currency (USAC)

Develop a government-backed cryptocurrency based on the XRP/Ripple platform which will be the basis for all transactions for the country. This will become a central currency that the US will move to instead of relying on The Federal Reserve or other entity. In the meantime, the government will provide cards through a service like Plaid or Stripe Issuing that give all people access to this new currency in the form of USD.

#### Why?

At its core, the United States economy is built on debt. All money that enters circulation begins as debt for the United States government, and comes with accrued interest (in most circumstances).

Cryptocurrency is an inherently debt-free currency, with transactions being one-way, and is future-proof to ensure that we're always using the best encryption possible when broadcasting transactions. XRP/Ripple is the ideal platform for a government, as all new blocks are mined by the blockchain creator. This means that there is a constant rate of new money being created, which will reach equilibrium to match the growth in US GDP.

## Step 2 - Conduct Opt-In Property Buyouts

Provide optional buyouts for all individuals or businesses who currently own a home or homes equal to the exact value of the home, or the amount left on loan (whichever is greater) in this new government currency. These buyout homes are then made available through a central system for registering your address in the US, for a fee that fluctuates based on home value.

#### Why?

This serves two purposes. By conducting buyouts with options for transparent pricing for rent, many people who would otherwise be unable to buy or purchase a home will now have the capacity to take a step up. There are 6 homes for every homeless person in the USA, so this will be a direct step towards ending homelessness... Now for poverty...

## Step 3 - Introduce a transparent UBI

Introduce a UBI based on the rent payments for the properties you've bought out. 80% of funds generated through the rent payments from buyouts above can be directly sent back to the populace.

#### Why?

With average rent payment currently being about a thousand dollars within the US, this means we can expect a UBI somewhere around $800. This will also generate somewhere in the range of 9.7 billion dollars every month for the US government, as there are currently 48.5 million known renters in the US right now. Given that this program will make social security, unemployment, etc, no longer required, this change will actually save the united states money, and get the country closer to spending less than it earns.

## Step 4 - Abolish Income Tax

Abolish all federal income tax. Period. It's not needed with the above. You control the currency, you don't need to worry about money. Cryptocurrency itself has a standard inflation rate that will work fine. Any created money goes into the hands of the government, anyway.

#### Why?

Income tax has always been a highly debated subject, and this provides an easy solution to just removing the system entirely. People who own their properties will not need to contribute to this system whatsoever, and instead will only benefit from it.

## Step 5 - Police Reformation and Removal

Remove police forces from all areas that are fully bought out around the US. The police system in America is designed specifically to target people who are poor. Bought-out areas will have none of these people, and therefore the police force can naturally dissolve as it becomes less and less relevant.

## Finally...

Let the free market take care of the rest. All people who are in need will be uplifted, and all who are rich now will stay rich.
