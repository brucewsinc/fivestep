# Five Step Approach to Saving America

- Develop a government-backed cryptocurrency based on the XRP/Ripple platform which will be the basis for all transactions for the country. This will become a central currency that the US will move to instead of relying on The Federal Reserve or other entity.
- Provide buyouts for all individuals or businesses who currently own a home or homes equal to the exact value of the home, or the amount left on loan (whichever is greater) in this new government currency. These buyout homes are then made available through a central system for registering your address in the US, for a fee that fluctuates based on home value.
- Abolish income tax. It's not needed with the above. You control the currency, you don't need to worry about money. Cryptocurrency itself has a standard inflation rate that will work fine. Any created money goes into the hands of the government, anyway.
- Remove police forces from all areas that are fully bought out. The police system in America is designed specifically to target people who are poor. Bought-out areas will have none of these people.
- Let the free market take care of the rest. All people who are in need will be uplifted, and all who are rich now will stay rich.
